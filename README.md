cd bertok

compiled up with

```console
mvn clean package
```

### Starting Webservice Locally

```console
export NEO4J_URI=
export NEO4J_USERNAME=
export NEO4J_PASSWORD=
export NEO4J_DATABASE=
```

Then start webservice with:

```bash
./jetty-start.sh
```

Press `Ctr-C` to stop the webservice and delete generated directories if needed when done.

### Deployment
